# Randomness
How do we code Randomness ?

## Hardware random number generator
* hardware/true/non-deterministic/physical random number generator
* generates random numbers from a physical process capable of producing entropy (in other words, the device always has access to a physical entropy source)
* Nature provides ample phenomena that generate low-level, statistically random "noise" signals, including thermal and shot noise, jitter and metastability of electronic circuits, Brownian motion, atmospheric noise.

  Noise source > analog signals > digitizer > bit stream > conditioner(extractor) > random number
